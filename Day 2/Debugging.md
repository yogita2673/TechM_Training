# Advanced Debugging: Notes and Assignment

## 3.1. Introduction to Debugging

### 3.1.1. Learning Goals

By the end of this module, students should be able to:

- Understand the significance of debugging in the software development lifecycle.
    ```
    Debugging is a crucial phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) as it ensures the reliability, functionality, and security of software applications.
    Here‚Äôs why debugging is significant:
    1. Error Detection and Resolution
    Helps identify logical, syntax, and runtime errors in the code.
    Ensures that the software behaves as expected, reducing failures.
    2. Improves Software Quality
    Fixing bugs enhances the performance, usability, and stability of the application.
    Ensures that the software meets user expectations and requirements.
    3. Saves Time and Cost
    Early debugging prevents costly fixes in later stages of development.
    Reduces the risk of delays in deployment by addressing issues proactively.
    4. Enhances Security
    Identifies and fixes vulnerabilities like SQL injections, buffer overflows, and authentication flaws.
    Ensures data privacy and prevents cyber threats.
    5. Streamlines Maintenance
    Makes the codebase more maintainable and easier to scale in the future.
    Facilitates easier integration of new features.
    6. Improves Developer Productivity
    Debugging tools like Chrome DevTools, GDB, Postman, VS Code Debugger help in efficient issue resolution.
    Reduces frustration by providing insights into code behavior.
    7. Ensures Compliance with Standards
    Helps in meeting industry standards like ISO, IEEE, and OWASP security guidelines.
    ```
- Identify common types of programming errors.
    ```
    1. Syntax Errors
    - Occur when the code violates the rules of the programming language.
    - Detected by the compiler or interpreter before execution.
     2. Runtime Errors (Exceptions)
    - Occur during program execution due to invalid operations.
    - Can cause the program to crash.
    3. Logical Errors
    - The program runs but produces incorrect results due to flawed logic.
    - Hard to detect since there are no error messages.
    4. Semantic Errors
    - The code is syntactically correct but does not achieve the intended purpose.
    age = input("Enter your age: ")  # Missing type conversion
            if age > 18:  # TypeError: str cannot be compared to int
            print("Adult")
    5. Compilation Errors
    - Found in compiled languages (C, Java) before execution.
    - Include syntax errors, type mismatches, or missing dependencies.
     int x = "Hello";  // Type mismatch error
    6. Memory Errors
    - Related to inefficient memory usage, leading to leaks or crashes.
    7. Indentation Errors
    - Python enforces indentation, and incorrect indentation leads to errors.
    ```
- Apply various debugging techniques to isolate and fix bugs.
- Utilize debugging tools effectively.

1. Write Clean and Readable Code ‚úçÔ∏è
‚úÖ Why?
Clean code is easier to read, understand, and maintain.
2. Use Version Control (Git) üåç
‚úÖ Why?
Allows you to track changes and revert to stable versions if needed.
3. Follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) ‚úÖ
‚úÖ Why?
- Write unit tests before writing the actual code.
- Use pytest, unittest, or Jest for automated testing.
4. Use Static Code Analysis Tools üîç
‚úÖ Why?
- These tools automatically detect errors and enforce best coding practices.
‚úÖ How?
- Use Pylint, Flake8, or SonarQube to analyze Python code.
5. Handle Errors and Exceptions Properly ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Use try-except blocks to handle exceptions gracefully.
6. Keep Functions and Modules Small (Modular Code) üîÑ
- Split large functions into smaller, independent ones
7. Use Debugging and Logging Tools üõ†Ô∏è
- Helps track errors in production without affecting users.
- Use logging instead of print() for better debugging.
```
- Master the use of debugging tools and techniques.
- Practice advanced problem-solving skills.

## 3.2. Programming in the Real World

In real-world programming, code rarely works perfectly on the first try. Debugging is a critical skill that involves identifying and fixing errors in code. Professional developers spend a significant portion of their time debugging and ensuring code reliability. Understanding the art of debugging can make the difference between a novice and a proficient developer.

### Common types of errors:

- **Syntax Errors:** Mistakes in the code structure (e.g., missing colons, unmatched parentheses).
- **Runtime Errors:** Errors that occur while the program is running (e.g., division by zero).
- **Logic Errors:** The program runs without crashing but produces incorrect results.

### Debugging often involves:

1. Reproducing the error.
2. Isolating the problematic code.
3. Fixing the bug.
4. Testing thoroughly to ensure the fix is correct and doesn‚Äôt introduce new issues.

## 3.3. Debugging

### 3.3.1. How to Avoid Debugging

While debugging is inevitable, writing clean and predictable code reduces the chances of bugs. Here are strategies to minimize bugs:

- **Write Clear Code:** Use meaningful variable names and write self-explanatory functions.
- **Test Incrementally:** Test your code step-by-step rather than writing everything at once.
- **Use Assertions:** Assertions help catch unexpected states early.
- **Version Control:** Commit working code often, so you can easily revert to a stable state.
- **Peer Reviews:** Having another person review your code can uncover issues you might have missed.

### Tools and Techniques:

- **Print Statements:** Insert print statements to trace variable values.
- **Debuggers:** Use tools like Python's built-in `pdb` or IDE-integrated debuggers.
- **Logging:** Implement logging to track the flow of execution and catch unexpected behaviors.
- **Rubber Duck Debugging:** Explain your code to someone (or an inanimate object) to uncover mistakes.

### Pro Tips:

- Break down problems into smaller chunks.
- Focus on one bug at a time.
- Write test cases for critical parts of your code.
- Avoid making multiple changes at once while debugging.

### Understanding Try-Except (Try-Catch)

The `try` and `except` blocks in Python help handle exceptions gracefully, ensuring the program doesn‚Äôt crash unexpectedly.

```python
try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero!")
```

#### Steps to Use Try-Except:

1. Identify the code that might raise an exception.
2. Wrap the risky code inside a `try` block.
3. Use `except` to handle specific exceptions.
4. Optionally add `else` for code that runs if no exceptions occur and `finally` for cleanup actions.

## Advanced Debugging Assignment

### 1. Error Classification

Identify the type of error in the following code snippets and fix them:

```python
# a) Syntax Error
for i in range(5)
    print(i)

# b) Runtime Error
x = 10 / 0

# c) Logic Error
def calculate_area(radius):
    return 2 * 3.14 * radius  # Incorrect formula for area
```

### 2. Debugging Complex Functions

Debug the following function and correct the mistakes:

```python
def process_data(data):
    total = 0
    for item in data:
        total += int(item)  # This may throw an error if item is not convertible to int
    return total / len(data)  # Handle division by zero error

print(process_data(['10', '20', 'abc', '30']))
```

### 3. Advanced Debugging Challenge

You‚Äôre given a function that fails intermittently. Investigate the bug and fix it:

```python
import random

def unreliable_function():
    number = random.choice([0, 1, 2])
    return 10 / number

for i in range(10):
    print(unreliable_function())
```

### 4. Writing Debug-Friendly Code

Refactor the following function to improve readability and add error handling:

```python
def calculate_discount(price, discount):
    return price - (price * discount / 100)

print(calculate_discount(100, '10%'))
```

### 5. Rubber Duck Debugging

Explain the following code snippet step-by-step as if you‚Äôre teaching someone unfamiliar with coding:

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = 1
for num in numbers:
    result *= num
print("Product:", result)
```

### 6. Advanced Challenge: Debug a Multi-threaded Program

Fix the race condition in the following code:

```python
import threading

counter = 0
def increment():
    global counter
    for _ in range(100000):
        counter += 1

threads = [threading.Thread(target=increment) for _ in range(2)]
for t in threads:
    t.start()
for t in threads:
    t.join()

print("Counter:", counter)  # Expected: 200000
```

### 7. Activity: Debug with Breakpoints

Learn to use breakpoints in your IDE (e.g., VSCode, PyCharm) to inspect variable states step-by-step.

**Steps:**

1. Open your IDE and load the following code:

```python
def divide(a, b):
    result = a / b
    return result

a = 10
b = 0
print(divide(a, b))
```

2. Set a breakpoint at the line where `result` is calculated.
3. Run the code in debug mode.
4. Inspect the values of `a` and `b` before the division.
5. Step through the code to observe the flow of execution.
6. Fix the division by zero error and re-run the code.
