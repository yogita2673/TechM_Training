## Advanced Debugging Assignment

### 1. Error Classification

Identify the type of error in the following code snippets and fix them:

```python
for i in range(5)
    print(i)

x = 10 / 0

def calculate_area(radius):
    return 2 * 3.14 * radius
```

Answer - When a number is divided by zero in Python, it raises a ZeroDivisionError. We can handle this error in this way- 

```python
def safe_division(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return "Error: Division by zero is not allowed"
    return a / b

print(safe_division(10, 2))  # Output: 5.0
print(safe_division(10, 0))  # Output: Error: Division by zero is not allowed
```

### 2. Debugging Complex Functions

Debug the following function and correct the mistakes:

```python
def process_data(data):
    total = 0
    for item in data:
        total += int(item)
    return total / len(data)

print(process_data(['10', '20', 'abc', '30']))
```
Answer-  Errors in the Code:
ValueError:

The list contains 'abc', which cannot be converted to an integer.
Attempting int('abc') will raise a ValueError.
ZeroDivisionError (Potentially):

If data is an empty list ([]), dividing by len(data) will result in a ZeroDivisionError.
```python
def process_data(data):
    total = 0
    count = 0  # To track valid numeric entries
    
    for item in data:
        try:
            total += int(item)
            count += 1  # Increment count only for valid numbers
        except ValueError:
            print(f"Warning: '{item}' is not a valid number and will be skipped.")
    
    if count == 0:
        return "Error: No valid numbers to process"
    
    return total / count  # Avoid division by zero

# Test cases
print(process_data(['10', '20', 'abc', '30']))  # Expected Output: 20.0
print(process_data([]))  # Expected Output: Error message
```


### 3. Advanced Debugging Challenge

You‚Äôre given a function that fails intermittently. Investigate the bug and fix it:

```python
import random

def unreliable_function():
    number = random.choice([0, 1, 2])
    return 10 / number

for i in range(10):
    print(unreliable_function())
```
Answer- If the number is divided by 0 (that is given in choice array) then it will raise error of ZeroDivisionError. So we handle this using the if condition. 

```python
import random

def unreliable_function():
    number = random.choice([0, 1, 2])  # Step 1: Select a random number from [0, 1, 2]
    
    if number == 0:  # Step 2: Check if the number is 0
        return "Warning: Division by zero avoided"  # Step 3: Return warning if number is 0
    
    return 10 / number  # Step 4: Perform division if number is not 0

for i in range(10):  # Step 5: Repeat 10 times
    print(unreliable_function())  # Step 6: Call the function and print the result
```

### 4. Writing Debug-Friendly Code

Refactor the following function to improve readability and add error handling:

```python
def calculate_discount(price, discount):
    return price - (price * discount / 100)

print(calculate_discount(100, '10%'))
```
Answer
```python
def calculate_discount(price, discount):
    try:
        discount = float(str(discount).replace('%', ''))
        if discount < 0 or discount > 100:
            return "Error: Discount must be between 0 and 100."
        return price - (price * discount / 100)
    except ValueError:
        return "Error: Invalid discount format."
print(calculate_discount(100, 10))      # Output: 90.0
print(calculate_discount(100, '10%'))   # Output: 90.0
print(calculate_discount(100, '10'))    # Output: 90.0
print(calculate_discount(100, 'abc'))   # Output: Error 
print(calculate_discount(100, 150))     # Output: Error
```

### 5. Rubber Duck Debugging

Explain the following code snippet step-by-step as if you‚Äôre teaching someone unfamiliar with coding:

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
result = 1
for num in numbers:
    result *= num
print("Product:", result)
```
Answer:
```python
Step1: - We create a list called numbers that contains [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
- We initialize a variable result with 1 because multiplying by 1 does not change the value.
Step2: - The for loop iterates through each element in numbers:
1Ô∏è‚É£ First loop: result = 1 * 1 ‚Üí result = 1
2Ô∏è‚É£ Second loop: result = 1 * 2 ‚Üí result = 2
3Ô∏è‚É£ Third loop: result = 2 * 3 ‚Üí result = 6
4Ô∏è‚É£ Fourth loop: result = 6 * 4 ‚Üí result = 24
5Ô∏è‚É£ Fifth loop: result = 24 * 5 ‚Üí result = 120
Step3: -The loop has finished, and result now holds 120.
The program prints:
Product: 120
```

### 6. Advanced Challenge: Debug a Multi-threaded Program

Fix the race condition in the following code:

```python
import threading

counter = 0
def increment():
    global counter
    for _ in range(100000):
        counter += 1

threads = [threading.Thread(target=increment) for _ in range(2)]
for t in threads:
    t.start()
for t in threads:
    t.join()

print("Counter:", counter)  # Expected: 200000
```
Answer: Fixing the Race Condition Using a Lock üîí 
The issue in my code is that multiple threads are modifying the shared variable counter at the same time, leading to data corruption.
‚úÖ Solution: 
Use a threading.Lock
A lock ensures that only one thread at a time modifies counter, preventing lost updates.
```python
import threading

counter = 0
lock = threading.Lock()  # Create a Lock

def increment():
    global counter
    for _ in range(100000):
        with lock:  # Lock before modifying counter
            counter += 1

# Create and start threads
threads = [threading.Thread(target=increment) for _ in range(2)]
for t in threads:
    t.start()
for t in threads:
    t.join()

print("Counter:", counter)  # Correct output: 200000

```

### 7. Activity: Debug with Breakpoints

Learn to use breakpoints in your IDE (e.g., VSCode, PyCharm) to inspect variable states step-by-step.

**Steps:**

1. Open your IDE and load the following code:

```python
def divide(a, b):
    result = a / b
    return result

a = 10
b = 0
print(divide(a, b))
```

2. Set a breakpoint at the line where `result` is calculated.
3. Run the code in debug mode.
4. Inspect the values of `a` and `b` before the division.
5. Step through the code to observe the flow of execution.
6. Fix the division by zero error and re-run the code.

Answer 
```python
def divide(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return "Error: Cannot divide by zero"
    result = a / b
    return result

a = 10
b = 0
print(divide(a, b))  # Output: Error: Cannot divide by zero

```

### 8. Memory Leaks and Performance Debugging

Optimize the following code and fix potential memory leaks:

```python
import time

def inefficient_function():
    result = []
    for i in range(100000):
        result.append(i * 2)
    time.sleep(2)
    return result

print(len(inefficient_function()))
```
Answer
‚úÖ Optimized Solution (Using Generator)
Instead of storing all values in a list, we can use a generator, which produces values one at a time, reducing memory usage.
```python
import time

def efficient_function():
    for i in range(100000):
        yield i * 2  # Generates values one at a time

# Convert to list only when needed (for testing purposes)
data = list(efficient_function())  
print(len(data))  # Output: 100000

# Alternative: Using a loop instead of storing everything
# for num in efficient_function():
#     process(num)  # Perform operations without storing all values

```

### 9. Unexpected None

Debug why the function returns `None`:

```python
def add(a, b):
    result = a + b
print(add(3, 4))
```
Answer : 
The function calculates the sum (result = a + b) but does not return the value.
Since there is no return statement, Python implicitly returns None.
```python
def add(a, b):
    result = a + b
    return result 

print(add(3, 4))  # Output: 7

```


### 10. Silent Failures

Identify why the code doesn't raise an error:

```python
try:
    result = 10 / 0
except:
    pass
print("No error detected!")
```
Answer
```python
try:
    result = 10 / 0  # This causes ZeroDivisionError
except:  # This catches ALL exceptions but ignores them
    pass  # Silently ignores the error

print("No error detected!")  # Executes even though an error occurred
```
