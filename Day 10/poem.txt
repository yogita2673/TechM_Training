The sun sets in the west,
Painting the sky with its golden crest.
Birds fly home, wings spread wide,
As stars in the night begin to glide.

The moon rises with a gentle glow,
Whispering secrets only night can know.
The world is calm, peaceful, and still,
A moment of silence, the heart does fill.

Under the stars, the world sleeps tight,
Waiting for the sun to return with light.
