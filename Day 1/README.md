# Variables, Statements, and Expressions  

## **Introduction**  

### **Learning Goals**  
By the end of this task, I will be able to:  

- Understand the basics of variables, expressions, and statements in Python.  
- Differentiate between data types and apply type conversions.  
- Properly name variables following Python conventions.  
- Grasp the flow of execution through function calls and expressions.  
- Update and reassign variables effectively.  

### **Objectives**  
- Identify values and their data types.  
- Perform operations using different operators.  
- Understand function calls and their role in expressions.  
- Explore Python’s order of operations.  
- Practice variable reassignment and updating.

## **Values and Data Types**  

### **Research**  
- A **value** in Python is any data that can be assigned to a variable or used in an operation.  
- Python has different **data types**, including:  
  - Integers (whole numbers)  
  - Floats (decimal numbers)  
  - Strings (text)  
  - Booleans (True/False)  

### **Fun Fact**  
Python is **dynamically typed**, which means I don’t have to specify the type of a variable when creating it.  

---

## **Operators and Operands**  

### **Research**  
- Python has different types of **operators**:  
  - **Arithmetic operators** (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**`)  
  - **Comparison operators** (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`)  
  - **Logical operators** (`and`, `or`, `not`)  

### **Fun Fact**  
Python uses `//` for **floor division**, meaning it always returns an integer result.  

---

## **Function Calls**  

### **Function Calls as Part of Complex Expressions**  

### **Fun Fact**  
Functions in Python are **first-class objects**, meaning they can be stored in variables and passed as arguments to other functions.  

---

## **Data Types**  

### **Research**  
Python is **dynamically typed**, meaning the type of a variable is determined at runtime.  

---

## **Type Conversion Functions**  

### **Fun Fact**  
Python provides built-in functions like:  
- `int()` – Converts a value to an integer.  
- `float()` – Converts a value to a float.  
- `str()` – Converts a value to a string.  

---

## **Variables**  

### **Research**  
- A **variable** in Python is a named storage location in memory.  
- Python automatically manages memory allocation for variables.  

---

## **Variable Names and Keywords**  

### **Fun Fact**  
Python has **reserved keywords** that cannot be used as variable names. To see them, I can use:  

```python
import keyword
print(keyword.kwlist)
```

---

## **Choosing the Right Variable Name**  

### **Challenge**  
Why is `total_price` a better variable name than `tp`?  
- `total_price` is more **descriptive** and makes the code **easier to read**.  

---

## **Statements and Expressions**  

### **Research**  
- A **statement** is a complete line of code that performs an action.  
- An **expression** is a combination of variables, values, and operators that produces a result.  

---

## **Order of Operations**  

### **Fun Fact**  
Python follows the **PEMDAS** rule:  
- **P**arentheses  
- **E**xponents  
- **M**ultiplication / **D**ivision  
- **A**ddition / **S**ubtraction  

---

## **Reassignment and Updating Variables**  

### **Research**  
- **Reassignment** means assigning a new value to an existing variable.  
- **Updating** variables can be done using shorthand operators (`+=`, `-=`).  

---

## **Conclusion**  

This learning task helped me understand the **basics of variables, expressions, and statements in Python**. I learned about **data types, operators, function calls, variable reassignment, and order of operations**. Practicing these concepts with exercises has given me a better grasp of how Python handles data.
