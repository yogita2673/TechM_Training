# Sequences in Python: Comprehensive Notes

## 5.1 Introduction: Sequences

In Python, a **sequence** is an ordered collection of items. The order of elements is preserved, and each element is accessible via its index. The main types of sequences in Python are:

- Strings
- Lists
- Tuples

### 5.1.1 Learning Goals

- Understand different types of sequences.
- Learn how to manipulate sequences.
- Perform operations like slicing, concatenation, and repetition.

### 5.1.2 Objectives

- Identify and use strings, lists, and tuples.
- Access elements using indexing and slicing.
- Perform operations like count, index, split, and join.

---

## 5.2 Strings, Lists, and Tuples

### 5.2.1 Strings

A **string** is an immutable sequence of characters.

```python
text = "Hello, World!"
```

- Access elements using indexes:

```python
print(text[0])  # Output: H
```

### 5.2.2 Lists

A **list** is a mutable sequence used to store items of different types.

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
numbers[0] = 10  # Lists are mutable
```

### 5.2.3 Tuples

A **tuple** is an immutable sequence.

```python
tuple_example = (1, 2, 3)
# tuple_example[0] = 10  # Raises TypeError
```

---

## 5.3 Index Operator: Working with the Characters of a String

The index operator (`[]`) allows accessing elements by index.

```python
text = "Python"
print(text[1])  # Output: y
```

### 5.3.1 Index Operator: Accessing Elements of a List or Tuple

```python
my_list = [10, 20, 30]
print(my_list[2])  # Output: 30
```

---

## 5.4 Disambiguating []: Creation vs Indexing

- **Creation:**

```python
my_list = []  # Empty list
```

- **Indexing:**

```python
value = my_list[0]  # Access first element
```

---

## 5.5 Length

Use `len()` to get the number of elements:

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(len(my_list))  # Output: 4
```

---

## 5.6 The Slice Operator

Slicing extracts a portion of the sequence.

```python
my_list = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
print(my_list[1:4])  # Output: [1, 2, 3]
```

### 5.6.1 List Slices

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(numbers[1:4])  # Output: [2, 3, 4]
```

### 5.6.2 Tuple Slices

```python
tuple_example = (10, 20, 30, 40)
print(tuple_example[1:3])  # Output: (20, 30)
```

---

## 5.7 Concatenation and Repetition

- **Concatenation:**

```python
list1 = [1, 2]
list2 = [3, 4]
result = list1 + list2  # [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

- **Repetition:**

```python
my_list = [0] * 5  # [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

---

## 5.8 Count and Index

### 5.8.1 Count

Counts occurrences of an item:

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 2, 3]
print(my_list.count(2))  # Output: 2
```

### 5.8.2 Index

Finds the index of the first occurrence:

```python
print(my_list.index(2))  # Output: 1
```

---

## 5.9 Splitting and Joining Strings

- **Splitting:**

```python
sentence = "Python is awesome"
words = sentence.split()  # ['Python', 'is', 'awesome']
```

- **Joining:**

```python
words = ['Python', 'is', 'awesome']
sentence = ' '.join(words)  # 'Python is awesome'
```
